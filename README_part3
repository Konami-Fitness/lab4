To insert the quote at the end, I created an array of all the quote elements, took the last item in the array and cloned it, then edited the innerHTML with the quote. Then I used append child to add it on the to end of the document.

For the onmouseover and onmouseout listeners, I put all the div elements into an array. Then I used a for loop to iterate through them. For each one, the loop sets the onmouseover attribute equal to a function. The function uses the this keyword to edit the CSS for that div, changing the background color and margin. For onomuseout, I followed the same process, just reversing the the background color back to white and the margin back to 0.
