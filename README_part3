2) For part 2, we took the code from part 1, and bool flag so that we could make
sure that alert boxes would only display if the element tags were in the body.
If the clicked element was in the body tag, then an event listener would trigger
an alert box with the currentTarget elements tag name. The currentTarget was
essential to preserve event bubbling since the alerts needed to start with the
innermost element and change as different event listeners triggered the event. 

3) To insert the quote at the end, I created an array of all the quote elements,
took the last item in the array and cloned it, then edited the innerHTML with
the quote. Then I used append child to add it on the to end of the document.

For the onmouseover and onmouseout listeners, I put all the div elements into
an array. Then I used a for loop to iterate through them. For each one, the loop
sets the onmouseover attribute equal to a function. The function uses the this
keyword to edit the CSS for that div, changing the background color and margin.
For onomuseout, I followed the same process, just reversing the the background
color back to white and the margin back to 0.
